//	Test Case 8 Description
//	CSCI 3120 Winter 2017
//	Group 16

Purpose of test:
	Determine how multiple simultaneous requests for the same file
	are handled.


How it works:		
	Multiple requests for the same file are made at the exact same
	time. The MLFB scheduler is used to order and process the requests.


Expected Results:
	An output file with the format	->	test.8.M.out
	The expected Request completion order is: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
	But...
	*The request completion order is often scrambled or even random 
	(in appearance) due to the fact that all requests are coming in at the 
	exact same time. It is possible 1 or more requests are received a fraction
	of the time before other requests are also recieved. This creates the often 
	scrambled appearance of the completion order. Also running the test multiple
	times over in quick succession leads to the test being haulted completely with
	no 'request completion order' being generated. A '400 bad request' message is
	sometimes displayed when the test is haulted.*
