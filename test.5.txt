//	Test Case 5 Description
//	CSCI 3120 Winter 2017
//	Group 16

Purpose of test: 
        More SJF testing, except new requests come in part way through.
        Used to test the reorganizing of the queue.

How it works: 
         A couple come in at 0.0, they need to be sorted, then the next
         comes in during the processing of the first causing the need to be
         sorted again.

Expected Results: 
          An output file with the format	->	test.5.S.out
          Request completion order: 2  3  4  1  5
