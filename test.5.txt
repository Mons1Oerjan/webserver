//	Test Case 5 Description
//	CSCI 3120 Winter 2017
//	Group 16

Purpose of test: More SJF testing, except new requests come in part way through.
                 Used to test the reorganizing of the queue.

How it works: A couple come in at 0.0, they need to be sorted, then the next
              comes in during the processing of the first causing the need to be
              sorted again.

Expected Results: 2, 3, 4, 1, 5
