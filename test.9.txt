//	Test Case 9 Description
//	CSCI 3120 Winter 2017
//	Group 16

Purpose of test:
	Determine how requests with long connection and pause times affect
	the behaviour and functionality of the server. 


How it works:
	Various requests are made with varying connection and pause times.
	Some requests have a much larger wait/pause time than others to see
	how the server handles the clients that send requests quickly versus
	clients that take a much longer time to send requests.


Expected Results:
	An output file with the format	->	test.9.S.out
	Request completion order: 2 3 4 1 5 6 7
	The test takes atleast 10 seconds to complete as the last request is sent
	10 seconds after the test is started.
	
	*Interesting behaviour: requests that take longer than 10.5 seconds to 
	connect or are paused for longer than 10.5 seconds are not processed and
	no 'Request completion order' is outputted at the end.*
