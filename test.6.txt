//	Test Case 6 Description
//	CSCI 3120 Winter 2017
//	Group 16

Purpose of test:	
	Tests requests of various sized files above and below 8KB to
	determine the order the Round Robin scheduler processes each 
	request.


How it works:		
	Multiple clients connect at varying time intervals to request 
	large files of different sizes. The Round Robin scheduler is 
	used therefore there is a data response limit of 8KB. File
	sizes below and above 8KB will be requested from the server.


Expected Results:
	An output file with the format	->	test.6.R.out
