//	Test Case 6 Description
//	CSCI 3120 Winter 2017
//	Group 16

Purpose of test:
	Tests the order the Round Robin scheduler handles/processes
	requests of various sizes and request times. 
	


How it works:		
	Multiple clients connect at varying time intervals to request 
	files of different sizes. The Round Robin scheduler is 
	used therefore there is a data response limit of 8KB. File
	sizes above and below 8KB will be requested from the server.


Expected Results:
	An output file with the format	->	test.6.R.out
