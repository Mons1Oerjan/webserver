//	Test Case 4 Description
//	CSCI 3120 Winter 2017
//	Group 16

Purpose of test: 
        Mainly a test SJF for order. All requests come in at the same
        times. Needed for organizing the queue and picking the
        shortest requests in order.

How it works: 
        All requests come in at 0.0 with no delay and the scheduler must
        pick the shortest then run it and then the next and so on.

Expected Results: 
        An output file with the format	->	test.4.S.out
        Request completion order: 4  3  5  2  1
