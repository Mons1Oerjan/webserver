//	Test Case 7 Description
//	CSCI 3120 Winter 2017
//	Group 16

Purpose of test:	
	Tests the server's ability to detect and handle errors.


How it works:		
	Multiple requests are made with varying connection and pause times.
	Files requested are either valid, don't exist, or have some form of 
	error in the file name. The scheduler chosen does not matter but for
	the paramaters of the test the Round Robing scheduler is used.


Expected Results:
	An output file with the format	->	test.7.R.out
	6 requests were made
	Request 1 and 2 were found and processed successfully.
	Requests 3-6 were invalid and the message '404 file not found' was
	returned for each (i.e. 4 error messages were returned).
	
	Request completion order: 1 2 3 4 5 6
