//	Test Case 7 Description
//	CSCI 3120 Winter 2017
//	Group 16

Purpose of test:	Tests the server's ability to detect and handle errors.


How it works:		Multiple requests are made with varying connection and pause times.
			Files requested are either valid, don't exist, or have some form of 
			error in the file name. The scheduler chosen does not matter but for
			the paramaters of the test the Round Robing scheduler is used.


Expected Results:
	An output file with the format	->	test.7.R.out
